I had a forward slash defined in the label of a diagram node.

```
graph LR
    M[Main\n/]
```

This could be rendered successfully by other mermaid engines, like the one that renders the preview in the vscode plugin. But caused `mmdc` to crash with

```
Error: Evaluation failed: Error: Diagram error not found.
    at pptr://__puppeteer_evaluation_script__:45:17
    at ExecutionContext._ExecutionContext_evaluate (...)
    at process.processTicksAndRejections (...)
    at async ExecutionContext.evaluate (...)
    at async CDPJSHandle.evaluate (...)
    at async CDPElementHandle.$eval (...)
    at async renderMermaid (...)
    at async parseMMD (...)
    at async run (...)
    at async cli (...)
```

However, as soon as I add double quotes

```
graph LR
    M["Main\n/"]
```

everything works fine. So this is rather an issue to handle in `mermaid-js/mermaid-cli` (if at all).
